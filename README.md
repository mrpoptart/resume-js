============================ Generic Cover Letter =============================
===============================================================================

----------------------------------- TL;DR: ------------------------------------
I try to be the kind of programmer I would choose for my own team. I self-start 
and learn well. I realize that corporate culture is only as good as the place 
you make it, and I want to make it awesome. I want to keep growing with support 
from smart people, and I want to come to work every day with eager hope in my 
heart. 

------------------ Why Engineers Will Want to Work with Me: -------------------
As engineers, we face difficult challenges every day--it's what we love about 
our jobs. We want to work with people who want to work with us, who will ask 
questions and program in ways that make sense to the company. Lone Ranger 
programmers solve problems today, but hurt the team tomorrow. If we collaborate 
and communicate well, we can solve difficult problems in ways that are good for 
everyone at the company. We're looking for team members that balance work and 
play both at work and home, and I do that. 

------------------- Why Managers Will Want to Work with Me: -------------------
You're facing pressure from board members to deliver amazing things on time and 
to ensure that the team works well together. You need people who know when to 
speak up about problems, and who take initiative. you need a self-starter. I've 
run my own businesses successfully, but wanted to contribute to something 
greater than myself and focus on the part I do best. I communicate extremely 
well, which helps both my team to understand what I'm doing, but also 
management to understand why I'm doing it. 

---------------- Why Everyone Else Will Want to Work with Me: -----------------
Being part of a company is more than just being an engineer. Your company 
started from a small idea with amazing people and now you're growing, but 
cautiously--culture means a lot to your team. I go out of my way to make the 
place I work an even more awesome place. I've sponsored Movember drives, 
cupcake baking competitions, guacamole cookoffs, pot lucks, push-up clubs, and 
I wrote software to organize runs to In-N-Out long before Zip-Car did it. I 
realize that corporate culture is only as good as the place you make it, and I 
want to make it awesome. 

---------------------------- What I'm Looking For: ----------------------------
A company with a culture, people who care, software that needs help to get 
better, but has a purpose now. I want to contribute to something larger than 
myself, both at my company and with open-source projects. I want to keep 
growing with support from smart people, and I want to come to work every day 
with a smile on my face. I want to stay late because I believe in doing good 
work and because I really got into the groove at 4 PM. All of the other usual 
things apply here, too, like healthcare, a decent business plan, vision for the 
future and all that, but first thing's first.
